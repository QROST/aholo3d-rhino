# Validation record

Maintainer: CuriousArc · qrost. Candidate: 0.1.0-beta.2. Date: 2026-11-01.

## Verified locally

- Release solution build on Apple Silicon macOS with .NET SDK 8.0.129: zero warnings/errors; RhinoCommon 8.32.26160.13001 compile target.
- Offline automated suite: 179 passing tests, zero failures. Coverage includes raw World/RenderCloud/mesh envelopes, lossless task IDs, uncertainty after failed create replies, API/upload credential separation, single/multipart uploads, all supported PLY encodings, malformed/truncated input, more than one million streamed points, GLB/USD coordinate conversion, task-journal recovery and failed downloads.
- Prior beta.1 child-process pipe smoke (not rerun for this GS-only sidecar integration): empty-history response, correlated request IDs, unknown-method error envelope and clean EOF exit; no credential or service methods called.
- New GS suite: 41 passing cases covering strict source fields/SH order/encodings, covariance, camera projection, SH parity and inverse instance transform, smooth alpha and opaque depth before/between/behind layers. The original 29 geometry cases still pass, including a million-point stream.
- New realtime suite: 67 passing cases covering REST envelopes, credential isolation/redaction, stream fragmentation, ordered/coalesced patches, cancellation, shutdown races and explicit failed-cleanup retries. No live service was contacted.
- Portable CPU oracle generated four 257×257 PNGs and verified center values against closed-form alpha/depth calculations. These are numerical reference images, not Rhino screenshots. The deterministic 3-sigma alpha texture verifies byte-for-byte against its generator.
- Native host adapter compiles against RhinoCommon 8.32 with double-precision quad vertices, deterministic equal-depth ordering, cancellable document reloads, per-view resources and visible proxy fallback. Stock material alpha multiplication and deferred rendering order remain unverified.
- Build script syntax and Python packaging syntax checked. Public README/docs/NOTICE attribution uses CuriousArc and qrost; no developer home paths included.

Yak reports a benign content-name warning because assembly `Aholo.Rhino` differs from package slug `aholo-rhino`; both identities are intentional. Windows PowerShell packaging remains unexecuted.

Package-specific SHA-256 and archive verification receipts are generated beside each candidate in `artifacts/`. Package verification compares every payload to its staged source and validates Yak-normalized manifest fields and checks identity, Rhino target, platform and .NET 8 runtime configuration. Package generation does not install or publish the plugin.

## Not yet verified

Actual loading of this new plugin in Rhino; Rhino UI, native GS alpha/depth/SH appearance, Undo/Redo, save/reopen and large-file acceptance; Windows execution; Intel Mac execution; authenticated World generation; authenticated RenderCloud/mesh-ingestion and realtime WebSocket tests; World GS to cloud mesh-ID bridge; visual/camera/scale matching of cloud output. No service credits were consumed and no package was published.

A Windows-tagged package uses the same platform-neutral managed assemblies; that does not establish Windows compatibility at runtime. The cloud model transform assumes the fast ingestion pipeline preserves glTF units/axes, which its public contract does not explicitly guarantee. Follow [host acceptance](host-acceptance.md) before promoting a release.

## Stage outcome

M0 (plan) and M1 (data/reference math) have local evidence. M2 has a compiled, packaged native-viewport experiment; its host acceptance gate remains open. M3 has a protocol/session library with offline tests; it is not wired to a cloud viewport. M4–M6 (dedicated GPU/performance, coherent realtime cloud viewport, release acceptance) remain pending the documented host and service gates. See [the decision record](decisions/0001-native-gaussian-viewport.md) and [GS manual acceptance](gs-host-acceptance.md).

Local CLI installation, if performed, is recorded separately in `artifacts/` with installed-file hash verification. It does not establish that Rhino loaded or rendered the plugin successfully. No Windows execution, Mac/Windows native occlusion result, production performance number or cloud viewport is claimed by this validation record.
